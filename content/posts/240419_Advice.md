Wound up drunk again on Robson St.  
Strange 'cause we always agreed  
At the start of every evening  
That's the last place I want to be  
Coffee drinkers dressed in black with no sugar  
They don't give me no respect  
They say look her comes another one  
And I don't know what they mean yet  → <!--more-->

And I say  
Keep it light enough to travel  
Don't let it all unravel  
Keep it light enough to travel  


Promise me we won't go into the nightclub  
I feel so fucked up when I'm in there  
Can't tell the bouncers from the customers  
And I don't know which ones I prefer  
Promise me we won't go into the nightclub  
I really think that it's obscene  
What kind of people go to meet people  
Someplace they can't be heard or seen  

Keep it light enough to travel  
Don't let it all unravel  
Keep it light enough to travel

I broke the windows of the logging company  
Just to get a little release  
I had to throw down my accordion  
To get away from the police  

And I say  
Keep it light enough to travel
